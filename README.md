College Assignment, Programming

This assignment was used to demonstrate knowledge of Inheritance, Abstraction and Ploymorphism. It contains an abstract super class
"Person" which has two abstract subclasses of "Trainer" which is a concrete class and the other "Member" which is an abstract class
that has two concrete subclasses "PremiumMember" and "StudentMember".

A gym requires an app to periodically track assessments on individual members. Assessments capture essential
measurements on a the member at a given date. The trainer adds an assessment for a member and measurements and analytics can be
generated on the status of the member after a given assessment, such as their BMI, BMI Cateogry, and if their are of an ideal 
weight. The app enables a trainer to review assessments, and comment on any specific assessment.
